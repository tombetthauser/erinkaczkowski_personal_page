* my first day
* this is not a startup
* the energy here feels sustainable
* these people seem to be paid to work not paid to care
* not paid to pretend to care
* not competing for who cares the most
* kinda sorta maybe
* there are artists ard here
* there are parents here
* there are good people here
* i hate outlook

|      Day 3 - 2.23.2023       \________________________________________

* i hated everything
* now everything's cool again
* talked to my project manager
* confirmed my project
* worked on personal project material
* discussed a conference talk proposal
* this job will allow for this
* i'll be paid to code not paid to care
* all the corporate double-speak doesn't matter
* these people are engineers
* they're human beings
* my days will be my own
* I can pick up danny every day
* I can be with Erin every day
* I can cook and clean every day
* I can exercise every day
* the antithesis of make your passion your profession
* keep your passion safe from your profession
* something like that
* this is good
* this will be good
